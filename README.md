God and history will not forgive what you are doing to the party' was the message given by rebel leader Prashant Bhushan to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal through an open letter.

In an open letter to Kejriwal, six days after he was expelled from the party's National Executive, Bhushan even accused Kejriwal of turning AAP a "high command-oriented" party and betraying trust of lakhs of supporters.

Rejecting the charges that he worked for the party's defeat, Bhushan said he believed that rather than winning with wrong kinds of candidates and means, it's better to go with honourable candidates and run the risk of a possible loss.

"If I had wanted the party to lose, I would have resigned and gone public with my reasons that very time. If Yogendra Yadav wanted the party to lose, he would not have convened that meeting and stopped me from going public. Instead, he worked his heart out for this campaign, defended the party on innumerable occasions on TV. And yet you have the temerity to accuse even him, along with me, of working for defeat!" Bhushan said in the letter.


Bhushan alleged that AAP has become a supremo-oriented, high-command culture kind of party and said that at a time when Kejriwal should be showing his best qualities, his worst qualities have emerged.

"The removal of the Lokpal, us and others who questioned the manner of our removal, reminds one of Stalin's purge of dissenters in the Communist Party of Russia. You should read Orwell's Animal Farm to see the parallels between Stalin's Russia and what is happening in our party today," he said.

Bhushan also said it would be wrong on Kejriwal's party to think that people will forget about the "betrayal" if he delivered on good governance.

In the letter, Bhushan also accused Kejriwal of making "false and inflammatory" allegations against him, his father Shanti Bhushan and Yadav at the National Council (NC) meeting on March 28 and inciting the MLAs and some others present there.

In the letter, Bhushan elaborated on reasons for widening rift with Kejriwal and said the differences started after the Lok Sabha elections.

He said after the Lok Sabha elections, Kejriwal felt that the party was "finished" and could only be revived if it were able to form the government again in Delhi.

Bhushan said despite strong opposition from the party leaders, Kejriwal started efforts to get Congress' support to form government which was one of the major reasons of the rift.

"Instead of abiding by the majority decision, you said that while that may be the majority view, as the Convenor of the party, you have the right to take the final decision, and that you would go ahead with seeking Congress' support," he said.

Talking about the AVAM or Aam Aadmi Volunteer Action Manch, which had accused the AAP of receiving funds from shady companies, Bhushan said the group of volunteers wanted their voices heard in the party.

He alleged that there was conspiracy to crush the "rebellion" of the volunteers who felt that they were being used only like "slave labour". He alleged fabricated SMS was used to defame AVAM.
